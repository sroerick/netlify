Vayechi

1. Is your household in order?
   I think my furnace is dying, which is a bummer.

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?
   Discernment!

3. What are you seeking?
   I'm trying to cut out all the things in my life where I felt led to do something or compelled by the spirit unless I'm absolutely sure that was God.

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I've resolved to make and eat more Thai food, I think Thai food is very good. Um, hmm, that probably doesn't count as holiness.

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   I have a little cold coming out of travel and I'm thinking about that story where the one rabbi is sick and it keeps him from his devotion and he asks what he can do about it and the senior rabbi says "How do you know which is more pleasing to God, your prayer or your sickness" and so i'm not using that as an EXCUSE for this journal being short but maybe we could both just keep this in mind as I do this at the very last minute.

   I learned what publicans are!

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   I'm curious about this Matthew 16:19 which I have somehow never really quite noticed before: "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." I've read a bunch of pages online and I'm even more confused now.

   I was really hoping to do a word study on salt this week but I haven't gotten to it.
