GENESIS 6:9-11:32

**PROPHETS** : ISAIAH 54:1-55:5

**GOSPEL** : LUKE 17:20-27

The hebrew words for Ark are different: תבה is used for Moses' basket and Noah's ark, and ארן is used for the Ark of the Covenant. The New Testament was the one that first drew the connection between the two. God loves boxes! and he always uses them to make covenants. Usually on a mountain. And there's usually a 40 day and 40 night period of tribulation (Noah, Moses, and Jesus). I think the only other period of 40 days and 40 nights is Elijah (who went to Horeb.) Woah. Is Elijah an example of a failed covenant? Or a successful one, even? 

It's cool that our bound bibles today are like little boxes, even though during the time of the Torah they would have been scrolls. 

Whenever God starts giving builders dimensions, you know he means business. 

>and the windows of the heavens were opened.

Does this refer to the fact that there are waters above the firmament?

a sweet savour unto the lord

I think this is the first time we see the offerings made to the lord. 

I like Art Katz! and it's cool that he went to the seminary in my city. I looked up the seminary online and I don't feel at all called there. I bet he did not make friends with his Holocaust thing, though he's probably right. Hosea is a tough message to preach on. I got that word when I went to the EDM church in Minneapolis, across the river from Art's seminary. They have a program called "Love This City" where they very publicly feed the poor. Big yikes. 

His word about overeating being a sin definitely hit home. His word about healing reminds me of a joke: A rabbi says to an elder rabbi "I have this horrible affliction, a sickness, it keeps me from my prayers." The elder rabbi says "ah, but how do you know which is more pleasing to God, your prayers or your sickness?"

I am also reading Peace of Soul by Fulton Sheen. It's pretty good, though I am finding it a little bit pedestrian. Of course people in modern soceity are depressed because they don't know God. That doesn't seem particularly novel to me. 

OK, This is a dumb question but why is Abraham considered the father of Israel and not Noah?
