GENESIS 6:9-11:32

**PROPHETS** : ISAIAH 54:1-55:5

**GOSPEL** : LUKE 17:20-27

The hebrew words for Ark are different: תבה is used for Moses' basket and Noah's ark, and ארן is used for the Ark of the Covenant. The New Testament was the one that first drew the connection between the two. God loves boxes! and he always uses them to make covenants. Usually on a mountain. And there's usually a 40 day and 40 night period of tribulation (Noah, Moses, and Jesus). I think the only other period of 40 days and 40 nights is Elijah (who went to Horeb.) Woah. Is Elijah an example of a failed covenant? Or a successful one, even? 

It's cool that our bound bibles today are like little boxes, even though during the time of the Torah they would have been scrolls. 

Whenever God starts giving builders dimensions, you know he means business. 

> and the windows of the heavens were opened.

Does this refer to the fact that there are waters above the firmament?

> ה֗וּא אִשֵּׁ֛ה רֵ֥יחַ נִיחֹ֖חַ לַיהוָֽה
> a sweet savour unto the lord

I think this is the first time we see the offerings made to the lord. 

I like Art Katz! and it's cool that he went to the seminary in my city. I looked up the seminary online and I don't feel at all called there. I bet he did not make friends with his Holocaust thing, though he's probably right. Hosea is a tough message to preach on. I got that word when I went to the EDM church in Minneapolis, across the river from Art's seminary. They have a program called "Love This City" where they very publicly feed the poor. Big yikes. 

His word about overeating being a sin definitely hit home. His word about healing reminds me of a joke: A rabbi says to an elder rabbi "I have this horrible affliction, a sickness, it keeps me from my prayers." The elder rabbi says "ah, but how do you know which is more pleasing to God, your prayers or your sickness?"

I am also reading Peace of Soul by Fulton Sheen. It's pretty good, though I am finding it a little bit pedestrian. Of course people in modern soceity are depressed because they don't know God. That doesn't seem particularly novel to me. 

OK, This is a dumb question but why is Abraham considered the father of Israel and not Noah? 

I am evaluating something I read in Nicolas Roerich's work. Roerich was kind of a weirdo Orthodox Pagan and one of the founding fathers of this whole "spiritual tourism" virus that seems to have infected the west, but he is my name sake and there are some things that I like about him. I find it edifying and important to have both a broad knowledge of my namesake but also to have the descernment of what to retain and what to cast away. One of the things he said in the otherwise corny book "Shambala" which left me dumbfounded was the idea that "Beauty, simplicity, and fearlessness are covenants with God." 

We see the phrases "Glory and Beauty" and "The Beauty of Holiness" frequently

>[Ecclesiastes 3:11] - He hath made every \[thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

> Exodus 28:40 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty. 

> 1 Chronicles 16:29 Give unto the LORD the glory [due] unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 

Can these virtures be a covenant? If we seek simplicity, does God also provide it? 

> Jeremiah 31:33  “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel
>    after that time,” declares the Lord.
>“I will put my law in their minds
>    and write it on their hearts.
>I will be their God,
>    and they will be my people.
