Vayishlach

1. Is your household in order?
   Things are a little bit messy right now, to be perfectly honest. Working on getting all my old stuff out the door.

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?
   I don't have anything this week.

3. What are you seeking?
   To stand firmly on the word and to know the verses that I need to navigate the world. I'm back to starting arguments!

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I think that, as a result of prayer, my dream life has become a lot more active. In almost every case, my memorization practice, sobriety, prayer, has been useful in a dream and kept me focused during the night.

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   I'm getting a really detailed view on why I believe torah keeping is good and productive. It's really quite clear, isn't it?

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   I kept thinking about Jacob's insistence on getting blessings. Dude really fights for them.

Monday:
OK, it is monday morning and I am now switching to a daily blog format to track my rigor and devotion. Sad to report I am starting off this week (second day) with a couple failures. One, I fell asleep listening to the Torah Portion and didn't finish my evening prayers and subsequently didn't have active dreams. Two, I failed to wake up before sunrise. NOT SO HOT. I will be rushing today because of it. I recorded my audio version of the Torah portion this morning and will be editing tomorrow. I'm about to start my memorization practice and then will get some work in.

Tuesday:
Today went well! Got up early. Memorization is going well. I'm going through and very rigorously defending Torah following in scripture. I've definitely solidified from "it's a good idea to follow Torah" to "not following Torah is a bad idea."

Wednesday will is a good day! Ive got a couple appointments to keep today so I'll have to work extra hard to get proper work done. ("for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)"

Thursday: Another very good day. I asked God to wake me up on time and he did. I had good dreams. I dreamt that I got a prophetic word about the St. George trip! "Someone will get something at McCarran." It may be totally vague, and able to be completely fulfilled by nothing more than, you know, uh, traveling through an airport, but I woke up and I carried the word in my mind through an entire other dream, where I dreamed I was moving back to Montana, and was going to do a play that was set entirely in a tabernacle during sukkot (which is a fantastic idea for a play), and Vickie was directing it. Anyways, nobody wants to read about other people's dreams, sorry, so, long story short I feel that word isn't so important so much as the way I was able to successfully operate and remember the lord and his word throughout the dream process. Today I went through and studied out all the evidence I need to win the argument with my adventist friend that there isn't actually a difference between the law of God and the law of Moses. I am really, totally, and completely getting fed up with the response of "I'm too lazy" to not torah keeping. Like if you have genuine theological grounds, I mean, ok, it's still dumb, but whatever. but "it's just too much to learn" or I couldn't give up pork" or "it sounds complicated" is really just the most embarrassing thing to say, isn't it? Lord give me patience! I've been putting up with this crap for like, what, four whole months? I'm over it!

Friday: I got started late today, but it was a good day. I didn't feel as bad about not getting up on time because I felt like God asked me to stay up late to do some extra prayers. I had a dream that I was fighting Robot Mark Zuckerberg with a lead or iron pipe. Nothing I could do would hurt him! I kept throwing him off a balcony, and he kept coming back, and his robot arms were exposed, so I tried throwing him into water and that did it. Baptism works!

Saturday: It was a good sabbath. I'm spending a lot of time in Revelation.
