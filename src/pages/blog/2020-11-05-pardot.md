Toldot

1. Is your household in order?
   I'm always fixing stuff! But generally, yes I think so. I'm 9 days into my relationship with Miss Courtney Jane and it's going pretty well so far, so I'm gearing up to sell all my possessions and move to Billings and marry her. I don't want to sell this St. Paul property. I still feel as though the Lord wants me to hang on to this house and somehow maintain a presence or house for him in the city. I'm trying to figure out how to best be a good steward for this house, turns out some good Christian friends of mine may be starting a property management company. I'm worried that my reluctance to sell the house is based out of fear and not obedience, so I'm still praying through that, but as it stands I do believe providing housing for a Christian family might not be the worst thing in the world. I am praying to the Lord and asking him and will trust and act on his instructions!

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?
   Healing! in my shoulder and my shoulderblade or maybe my rib. I've had back problems forever and God has totally taken them away in the last 6 months, except for this absolutely piercing pain in my left shoulderblade. It's actually hilarious. I'm sitting here doing my flash cards totally unable to memorize shoulderblade, corner, rib, and wing, and there's an excruciating pain there. I totally know beyond a doubt that it's faith based and I have total faith in him to heal it but for one reason or another (LIKELY my own failings) it persists!

3. What are you seeking?
   I'd like to learn to work in the prophetic properly and with discernment. I don't really know how to do stuff. I have had intuitions and thoughts and patterns that I have in the past believed that I was responsible because I was just like, a really smart dude or something. Now I'm kind of revisiting those situations and realizing that maybe a lot of that was God giving me an insight. I'm not sure how to begin sorting that out or praying through that, so I'm just asking God for help and guidance.

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I am trying to memorize. I'm taking it pretty seriously, and I'm spending about an hour a day. I have always been just embarrassingly bad at it but I am giving that monument up to the Lord and I'm convinced that through rigor and devotion I will become awesome at it. I am continuing my other practices and incorporating them into my regular life but I am trying to build a routine and a daily practice of prayer, study, memorization, and exercise and it has been fruitful.

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   OK! I am probably late to the ball game on figuring this out but matzot is the root of matsah bread! Which I guess is kind of confirmation of this whole tzitzit / matsah bread / bread of surfaces connection I made before, I guess I just took the long dumb way around, true to form.

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   Jacob is a total weirdo, and what is the deal with Esau's hairy red hands?? I think out of all the patriarchs and old testament stories the stuff about Jacob might be some of the weirdest. I had an intuition that Esau's hands are somehow connected to the read leather and the furs of the Tabernacle, but I just haven't really been able to find anything to confirm this in any way. I also don't understand what the connection would be?? The best that I can get is that Esau was a hunter, which is a nomadic profession, and that the Tabernacle is a representation of a nomadic life, and also they did animal sacrifices there? Which is kind of like hunting but not really.

   I've been reading Gregory of Nyssa's Life of Moses and I LOVE IT. Probably my new favorite Christian extrabiblical writing. He talked about my tent thing! which was wild, he called it one of the deepest mysteries of the Christian faith which, uh, I mean, made me uncomfortable truth be told. I mean, ok, cool, yes fine I will try to accept that with grace and humility but I confess my gut reaction is "NO I AM NOT DESERVING OF THE DEEPEST MYSTERIES OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, GREG." (the actual quote is this:"we say that Moses was earlier instructed by a type in the mystery of the tabernacle which encompasses the universe... What we say is of course not obscure to those who have accurately received the mystery of our faith") But putting that aside, I just adore this book. Every single one of these paragraphs could be a whole sermon about the Christian walk, it's just super beautiful.

   I'm also reading Spurgeon! I started at the beginning and I'm two sermons into 3600 so only 17 more years until I'm done reading. He's just so cool. The thing that is sticking out to me is that from watching youtube you would think sabbath keeping and studying the law was like a 1700 year old heresy but it really seems like this modern trend of people saying it's totally bad and not good is like, less than 100 years old.

I am getting an absolute flood of stuff from the Lord about what's going on in my life and the things that he needs me to do and work on and it's super cool. Big changes in my life. God is moving quickly
