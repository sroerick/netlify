Chayei Sarah

1. Is your household in order?
   I have some tidying to do and a couple projects that need doing around the house. It's not a wreck or anything, but it's been better. I listen to audio bible while I clean and it's great!

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?
   This week I started a relationship up with a nice lady, so I would ask for prayers that I would approach that with dignity and humility and to continue to walk without lust or iniquity.

3. What are you seeking?
   I'm trying to filter and remove things and thoughts and words from my life that are not part of God's eternal nature. Redeem the time!!

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I'm trying to be more intentional about memorizing Bible verses.

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   I think I'm just continuing my walk in obedience and trying to be in service with the Lord. He's put some things on my heart and some tasks on my schedule and while they seemed totally insurmountable before, now they're done and it feels like it was effortless!

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   I have been practicing obedience and have seen some positive fruit! Whereas before I maybe had a tendency to get kind of lost in commentaries or other outside and manmade information, I have really striven to be spirit led and listen to God's voice for the last couple weeks, and the end result has been that I feel as though I'm experiencing the Torah Portions in an extremely visceral manner and that it's deeply intertwined with my life and the events therein. I feel as though next year when I revisit these portions that I will have much better retention and much more meaning imbued because of the way I've approached them.

This week isn't really as funny! But sometimes that's the way the communion wafer crumbles. This week I've been studying this word "dominion".

The first definition of dominion is domain. I, of course, have this little personal agenda of public domain stuff, but I think that really it ought to be called "God's Domain". When you copyright something, it is in your domain, or under your dominion, but when it is dedicated to the public domain or God's Domain you forfeit the control over the thing and give it to God.

This realization actually kind of led me, in a weird way, to an endorsement of the King James Bible. Last week I started doing audio recordings of my Torah Portions, which I've really enjoyed. I've started to use my own recordings in order to listen to the portion daily, which I find extremely useful. I often find sections and passages that I really don't like, or feel that I don't read well. Even though there's an unpleasantness to that, I feel as though it gets me deeper into the portion, because I have an audible indicator of my own textual misunderstandings. I think it's a fun way of doing the mitzvah of writing your own Torah Scroll. "put it in their mouths!"

I just started with the KJV because that's what I read in Baptist Church. However, it occurred to me that unless I was using a public domain Bible, what I was doing was actually illegal! I mean, I'm sure I wouldn't get in trouble for personal use, and even if I published it online (though I'm far too dissatisfied with my reading to ever do that), I doubt I'd get in trouble except with the greediest of publishers of translations. With that said, there is something that bothers me about participating in a system where following my mitzvah would be in some way illegal.

These are the bibles that I found that are listed as public domain:  
American Standard Version (ASV)
Darby Translation (DARBY)
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition (DRA)
King James Version (KJV)
World English Bible (WEB)
Young's Literal Translation (YLT)
Reina-Valera Antigua (RVA)
Biblia Sacra Vulgata (VULGATE)

Another definition of Dominion is "Sphere of Influence", which lets me loop this nicely into my study of Spheres.

Other notes:

Enoch is very neat.

I am more joyful and exuberant than I've ever been! and the baseline for that is pretty high. I am having the most fun I've ever had, I'm funnier than I've ever been (despite the dearth of humor in this post), my creative and work output is as high as it's ever been and I just feel as though God is continuing to fill my live and that bountiful and holy increase isn't going to stop any time soon. Oh and I have paid work now too, if only barely. Life is good!
