Lech Lecha

1. Is your household in order?

Things are a little messier today, and my front screen door broke in the wind last night. But will get these things in order tonight so that I can go vote and then flee to the hills.

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?

Grace, patience, and humility. Discernment. Protection for those who are in or near the city.

3. What are you seeking?

I've been trying to live every moment as though God is present in my life. I've been leaving the passenger seat open when I drive, which is maybe a little bit goofy but it serves as a good reminder and I don't want to seem rude.

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?

See above! I'm walking with Christ. I don't really have a practice for memorizing verses and I need to start doing that. This week I also felt the call to start recording myself reading Torah out loud, but I haven't begun doing that yet. I made a tallit (out of a turkish towel, it's more of a towelit)

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   My big lesson this week, in a couple different ways, was that I need to trust God to provide. Not that I didn't already, but in more direct and specific ways. For example, that I don't need to follow every news story or obsess with the latest stuff. I can just trust God to show me what he needs to show me. Or I don't need to fight or win arguments, I just need to trust God to open the heart of somebody. I'm trying to apply this in a lot of different ways.

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   The Thing below about the Tzitzit being the Challah bread was pretty cool!

One of the things that I've never been able to figure out this whole bit about Abraham calling Sarah his sister. It happens twice, and once with Isaac, and I just don't get it. I sat and prayed for a little bit about this and the best that I am able to come up with is that it is essentially a moment of the patriarchs being "unpatriarchal, or being bad servants to God.
The Pharoah gives Abraham a wealth anyways, and sends him on his way, though he only does so after being beset with plagues.

I found this link pretty good. Many others are not so good.

I'd like to continue my weird aspergy study of circles and boxes from last week with a study of corners. My dog is totally obsessed with corners and frequently sits with his nose buried in them. He also sometimes will try to hid things in corners, he seems to think that they're analogous to holes into which he can hide his bones.

I had trouble understanding the commandment to wear the tzitzit because I don't know if I wear rectangular clothes! (I didn't really know what a tallit was at the time) I love the idea of the tzitzit, though and made some and started wearing them. I was also looking at the commandment to not cut the corners of your head or your beard, and was a little stupified as to what that actually meant. I am growing out a beard right now, which I do roughly every 18 months in the hope that God will bless me with a slightly less weak beard with which I can cover up my extremely weak chin. I have two very sharp corners under my chin which form a somewhat odd-shaped goatee, and I am self conscious about how silly they look and normally trim them, and I guess those would be my corners. So God is commanding us/me to do things with corners but I don't know where the corners are!

I thought that the four rivers, in the garden of eden, stretching out to the four corners of the earth. As it turns out, corners are not mentioned in the bible until Exodus 25. God commands Moses to cast four gold rings and place them on the four corners of the ark. In an odd way, the rings would almost negate the corners. A ring can have anywhere between zero corners and four corners.

He also created the Ark and the Tabernacle in order to have corners. I'm having some major brainwaves about the Tabernacle because of this. So the rings are placed are placed on the four corners of the Ark in the same way that the tzitzit are placed on the four corners of our garments. The rings are used in order to carry the Torah around the land of israel, and the tzitzit are used in order for us to carry God's commandments around with us wherever we go. So the tallit would be like a little Ark of the Covenant, and which is why the tzitzit are the mark of gods covenant with us.

This also explains Challa bread! It's the bread of surfaces! The four "horns" are attached to the corners of the bread of surfaces, just like the four tzitzit. So Challah bread is braided because the tzitzit are a braid, and analogous to the horns of the bread of surfaces. Ok, this all seems obvious, but sometimes I am very slow and dumb.

Things that have corners: Beards, sea, temple, gates, jerusalem, walls, cornerstonnes, housetops, Moabb, beds, the land, streets, the earth.

If you're in to the trinity and all that, a box's corners are the places where three become one, where three separate lines and three separate faces meet as one.
For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.

Christ is, of course, the cornerstone. I'm not sure what a "corner gate" is. I think it's like... A gate that has corners. Or maybe a corner that has gates.

> After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner. nehemiah 3:19

> Nehemiah 3:31 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner. And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.

> There is a harlot who lies in wait at every corner:
> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, 8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, 9 In the twilight, in the evening\*, in the black and dark night: 10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. 11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)

So corners are hidden places. They are the last place you look for something. A recess, a nook or cranny. But they are also everywhere. We talk about seeing things "behind every corner". Which, I mean, it's a physical impossibility you can't hid behind a corner, you can only hide in one. Maybe we should just look at corners more!

I'm realizing I don't know a dang thing about Amos.

> Amos 3:12Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.

Corners also seem to be pretty integral to defining our three-dimensional space. The corner at the root of all space is called the axis. If it's true that God exists outside the three dimensions that we inhabit, then it would seem to me that the creation of the tabernacle and the creation of the Ark may be in some way the construction of our planar reality. Three dimensional space is defined as having an X, a Y, and a Z axis. Nearly every house is built to have corners where three lines intersect, just as the Ark and the tabernacle did.

So, if we're, hypothetically, working with a spherical earth, we don't really think about it as a sphere at all. To us, it is an infinite plane, mostly flat, with some nice mountains, upon which we can walk in one direction across the entirety of the plane and end up in the same place. Thus, we tend to map our planet in mostly two dimensions (x and y) and the third (z) is generally only used to describe altitude and all those nice mountains. Because we only interact with the surface of the earth, the actual shape of the earth is pretty much irrelevant to us as conscious beings. Thus, corners seem to exist at the north and south pole. Sometimes I think it'd be cool if the earth was donut shaped, instead, so that then you could go up to the north pole and instead of just going to the other side of the north pole you'd just show up at the south pole. What are we talking about again? Corners! OK, here's Ezekiel coming in hot with the good stuff:

> Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. 21 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. 22 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure. 23 And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.

CORNERS WITHIN CORNERS! I don't know exactly what this means. The measurements don't make any sense to me. I think we're back to the Bread of Surfaces though! We're affixing four corners of a court to each of the four corners. What does it all mean? Let's dive into our concordance in a futile attempt to wrap our puny minds around this multi-faceted bread.

Lord have mercy, there are a lot of different hebrew words that translate into "Corners". 6285, 3802,6438,6437,2106,3671,6434,4742,6471,7098,6763,6284,4740,7106, just in Hebrew. This oughta be Illegal. I don't think I will ever know what a corner is again.

- 2106: zavith: a corner זָוִית
- 3671: kanaph: wing, extremity : כָּנָף
- 3802: katheph shoulder, shoulder blade, side כָּתֵף (Interesting, I have a chronic weird pain in my rib / shoulder blade. This seems like a corner problem (see 6763))
- 4740: miqtsoa: a corner buttress - מַקְצוֹעַ·
- 4742: mequtsah: corner מְקֻצְעָה (mequtsah taco bell)
- 6284: paah: to cleave in pieces פָאָה (EXCUSE ME?)
- 6285: peah: corner, side פֵאָה (OK, we're kind of back on track, here, because sides and corners are shapes cleaved in peices but um, how exactly are they using the same word for sides and corners, my brain hurts?)
- 6435: pen: corner פֵן
- 6437: panah: to turn פָנָה
- 6438: pinnah: a corner פִנָּה (so panah pinnnah means to turn a corner, that's kind of cute)
- 6471: paam: a beat, foot, anvil, occurrence פַעַם (OK this one might just straight up be a hebrew typo)
- 6762: tsela: rib, side צֶלַע (I turned the corner in my tsela -- wait no, I'm just dytselaxic)
- 7098: qatsah: an end קָצָה (i'm about to put a קָצָה to this study)
- 7106: qatsa': scrape קָצַע

Well, OK. That's something, then. I'm loading these into my flash cards and giving up with this dumb study, we already figured out a bunch of fun stuff. There's probably more work to be done on dialing into some of these words, but honestly I'm kind of over it.

PS. WAIT! I just realized that I lived in Four Corners outside Bozeman and I'm laughing my little butt off.

Random Thoughts

I am trying to very clearly document this idea of "Who Told You That" and identify where spiritual ideas are coming from. I am realizing that most of what I would consider to be "my ideas" generally come from somebody else, and even the ones that come flooding in as though through the spirit are sometimes the result of some old memory that I have. Sometimes I have the sense that I've read it somewhere, but don't have a clue where, and don't have any idea how to find it. 10 years ago when I didn't really know about the holy spirit at all I would hear similar things, or a phrase from something I read would stick in my head and repeat it. That was a great boon to me in that time, which was not a happy time for me, but of course I wish I had understood the idea of discernment a little bit better.

Trying to extract meaning from the hebrew root of the word is exactly as silly as gematria.

I tried to do a study about our mystery king sending people home to till their fields and wife their wives before the war and I can't find anything. I did not search through the Book of Jasher, but next time I get called out for not knowing a book I am absolutely going to claim that it's somewhere in random apocrypha. Until I am proven otherwise, I have concluded that being a total wuss might not be biblical.

I'm not particularly interested in panicking over vaccines. It doesn't resonate with me. Like, it's definitely a problem and I'm definitely against it but I don't think it's inevitable and if it is then like, whoops, okay I might get martyred! It falls into a category of thought patterns that I don't really have a name for, but I would characterize as overreacting to the symbolic pattern of something that you've under-reacted to. For example -- Are you worried you won't be able to conduct business unless you have the mark of the beast? Try starting a vacation rental without using AirBNB. Try starting a retail or ecommerce business without using ebay or Amazon. Try conducting business without credit cards. Maybe the mark of the beast is the Apple logo on the cell phone you clutch in your hand. The trademark of the beast, hah. If you're really worried about being programmed through some mysterious nanobot tech, but you're still on Facebook, what exactly are you doing? Being programmed, that's what. It's like hearing a prophecy that a kid gonna kill you and murdering all the kids! Whoopsie daisy the real kid's got an ark, or a manger or something. That is how the enemy gets you to dedicate all your time towards fighting something which is already pre ordained
