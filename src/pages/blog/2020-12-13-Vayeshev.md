Vayeshev

1. Is your household in order?
   Yes'm my house is clean and vacant.

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?
   Please continue to play for healing for my shoulder! I am meeting with my new shofar friend Tim for him to do an intercession on my shoulderblade but I'm going to continue to ask for prayers on it.

3. What are you seeking?
   I am trying to take dominion over affliction and walk in healing, even though I don't really know any way how to do that.

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I'm praying a lot for the above taking dominion over afflictionn. I don't think I'm very good at it just yet but I'm pretty close.

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   I'm continuing a deep dive into the verses and literature about the law, and especially focusing on Acts 15 and what it means and what the purpose about the 4 edicts for new christians.

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   I've been thinking about BLOOD. Specifically the blood of the animal sacrifices and the sacrifices to idols. I watched a movie a long time ago about the native american Wendigo demon, which is a flesh eating cannibal that gets stronger as it consumes people, and I was thinking about body builders who just eat steak all day, and this all coalesced into a clearer understanding about why we don't eat blood and why it was one of the starter torah commandments that the apostles gave to the new gentiles in Acts 15. I'm very grateful for Jesus' Blood!!

Tuesday: I did not journal the last two days! Bad. I also slept in monday, which makes twice in the last two weeks I've started the week with a mess up. Not very godly! He started his big week pretty strong. I had a rough couple days. Courtney and I did a texting / phone call fast before I visit and the day the fast started I felt like I had to reconcile with a lot of lust and a lot of pride all at once. Nothing too dramatic just a lot of anguish and shame and seeking God. Monday I spent all day trying to rescue videos of my (passed away) mom from the computer demons. It was one of the most hellish days I've ever had, my back was killing me and I've never had so many computer problems inn my life. Literally, I couldn't get the videos because of a software that had demons in the logo. Lord knows why I ever used that software. But it is good and it is done and that was the hardest step of getting my _data_ life in order, instead of having the last 10 years of my digital life spread out across as many hard drives sitting in a shoebox.

Memorization practice is good, and I have been diligent. I am still really struggling with verses. I've made flash cards for Verse number, and verse, and I'm just too bad at them for it to do much good. So, I've started writing out the initials of each verse before I learn the actual verse. It's slow going but I actually feel like I'm making progress now. I'm also writing them out, and trying to go back and listen to the passages they're from, to try and get a little more context. Hebrew is getting easier! I remember words on the first try sometimes now! I still don't know vowels very well, and I definitely don't know the singing marks, and I need to do both of those. I've worked out some bugs in my system and it's a little more effective: I made sure to add the transliteration to all my cards and it's helped tremendously. I'm chugging along with Psalm 119 and I've just now decided that I'm hoping to have the entire thing done by January 1. Pray for me!

Thursday: oops no journal yesterday. AND I was chastized and regret writing and recording negative stuff. But I will not delete it nor will I try to write yesterday's journal. I spent a lot of time in the epistles yesterday. Corinthians 2 is really wild, and also a great pitch for tithing. I'm in Billings! I decided I'm a healer now. I feel like I ought to heal my own annoying psychosomatic shoulderblade before I heal others but that is delay tactics and cowardice. I'm really starting to not see any kind of dividing line between sin and affliction. I heard the prompting to ask a man if I could pray for him and I had the opportunity and I didn't ask him and I am repenting for it. I will pray a vague affirmation of 'pos vibes, dude' his way. I read a bunch of Spurgeon sermons on the law and he writes good stuff on it! Except he focuses on the 10 commandments a little bit. Which is good, the ten commandments are good. Have you read "Before the Law" by Franz Kafka? it's a little sad, and a lot funny, and obviously the dude needed Jesus but it's really a hoot. OK I'm falling asleep. I got kicked off a plane today! LONG DAY

Sunday: I have been super negligent this week and have lost track of things, so I am hurriedly finishing this up as we get ready to head for dinner. OK, God Bless! Talk to you soon.
