Vayetze

1. Is your household in order?
   I'm selling a bunch of possessions! I am simplifying my life and getting rid of things that I haven't used in a while or much or ever. I wrapped up a big chunk of lingering underpaid client work, and I finally have a web portfolio and can now properly market myself. Oh and I'm going to send you a tithe!

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life? That I am active and a servant to God in my dream life (see below)

3. What are you seeking?
   I'm spending a lot of time each night praying to God with extreme specificity to make my dream life more useful. I'm praying to be allowed to fight, to go where God needs me to go, to go to places that are important, to never shirk from training or a fight, to remember to pray if there is struggle or challenge, to remember to call on God, not to accept slowness or delays, and a lot more. I am treating every dream of dalliance and triviality as an affront against God and slowly, through prayer, I am eliminating all the dumb ones.

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I got up every day this week before sunrise except for one day (I was 20 minutes late that day). I'm continuing my memorization practice and it's been going surprisingly well. I'm in agreement about that word about sober-mindedness in this season. I'm not a heavy drinker but I do like a glass of scotch here and there, and last week God put on my heart that now is not the time. I also have a side project that I have been working diligently on, which I'm not supposed to discuss here. I will show you! it's a little bit lame but i'm pretty stoked about it.

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   I learned a lot about vaccines this week.

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   I realized that this weeks portion with Jacob's dalliances are kind of a mirror of the story of Abraham and Sarah and Hagar. Two generations later we have twice as many people and it's much more complicated and a little bit more annoying. I feel like this is a "be fruitful and multiply? "

I've been called three separate times to do research this week. I think I'm also going to be doing paid research work? I guess it's a season for research! I confess I have been slipping in my daily journaling practice and have been doing more and more catch up at the end of the week and it is time to put the kibosh on that! I have kept busy and am absolutely not drawing back from God but I committed to journals and have been negligent so that is no bueno. No more!
