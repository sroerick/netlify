Miketz

1. Is your household in order?
   Yes

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?
   Obedience and humility please.

3. What are you seeking?
   Obedience and humility

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I'm Just trying to be obedient in the stuff I already have.

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   I've been diving into Gary Wayne's stuff.

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   As I dive into Gary Wayne I am understanding a lot more about growing up in the Paradise Valley mountain cult and becoming much less tolerant about my parents' errant pagan views. My mom was a bloodline / Holy Blood Holy Grail and my dad was into Rosicrucian stuff.

OK, this week I have done memorization and read a lot of the epistles... That's the good stuff.

There is some stuff I have not been obedient in. I did not journal. I slept in some days. I did not talk to the man at the airport who the lord told me to talk to and ask if I could pray for. I did not record my Torah portion audio. I did not deliver the man from spirits. I was not thankful or joyful in my walk. I've been distracted in my night life. I watched too much youtube.

I also feel that in my haste to defend my views and my theology that I spoke out of pride and out of superiority. I repent from arguing doctrine with people more faithful and knowledgable than I am. I ask that God would grant me the strength to continue to do this in my walk but not with arrogance.

I'm repentant for the things I have failed at and the good work I have failed to do. I am joyful and thankful to the Lord for humbling me and pointing out the things where I acted in pride. I hope that all of my bible studies can be as vigorous as when I'm trying to defend my theological positions to my girlfriends pastor as not being apostasy. I'm putting last week away and moving victoriously into the next.
