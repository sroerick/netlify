Vayigash

1. Is your household in order?
   Yes

2. Is there anything I can pray for your life?
   To stop doing dumb stuff like running low on ammo and getting all slashed up

3. What are you seeking?
   Prayer and obedience and to stop saying so much dumb stuff

4. Are there any new things in holiness you have added to your life to walk in?
   I've done them before but I think I have to do more prayer walks

5. Is there anything new you have learned?
   um yeah like all the stuff we talked about

6. Anything in Torah, class, devotionals, or outside reading that “hit you?”
   I am thinking a lot about this camel through the eye of a needle thing. I've talked to a couple rich parents of friends in the last month or so and it blew me away how ungodly they were. I had looked up to them a lot. I was talking to all of them about God at one point or another. One of them asked me if I was more into God or into the community. Since it was the messianic jews, I answered without really thinking it through that I thought congregating was really important. It wasn't till later that I figured out she was talking about faking belief to go to church for networking. Then I was thinking about you and Kanye and the stuff you said tonight (Saturday) and how it really saddens me, and how he has literally thousands of people trying to prevent him from being godly, and preventing him from fulfilling those responsibilities he has to you and Cody. I am praying that I have killed every part of myself that might have joined your ministry for networking.

Monday - Good day today! I got some work done and packed and accomplished everything. I read through Hebrews again and I'm curious about the structure of the thing. I feel like it HAS to be paralleling some some old testament structures with the repetition and some such but I'm too thick to know what it is. Maybe tabernacle stuff? That's my best guess. Or maybe he's just doing some cute lil chiasms.

Wednesday: (saturday note: wow this journal is lame) OK, today was interesting. I spent a long time doing memorization and was pretty frazzled and I don't think I got to everything. I was working on my Hebrew and and frustrated at my own inability to remember stuff so I was praying about it and remembered a time when I was being shown Hebrew letters in my mind. I am not good at visualization and if somebody tells me to picture something in my head I find it extremely hazy and I have a very hard time seeing it. So I was very excited to be seeing letters in my mind, as if they were glowing under light. I pretty quickly grew out of that phase, but it came to mind as I was struggling and praying for memory. So I tried to picture the letters I was studying in my mind. What I quickly found was that the artificial light of the hallway I was in and ESPECIALLY the screen I was staring at in order to memorize was present in my mind when I closed my eyes and tried to visualize. It made me start to wonder if that was part of why I find going and being outside so soothing, because there is no afterimage of artificial, electric lights to cloud your blinky time (this is what i've decided to call when you close your eyes). so then I was trying to google what that after image thing in your blinky time was called (wow, the way I talk it's a miracle I can even google anything), and I realized it was called persistence of vision (mentioning the Salvador Dali painting Persistence of Memory). This, in turn, made me realize that I spend a whole year in college working on a project called persistence of vision and it's relationship to memory, and I don't feel like I've ever been so embarrassed to forget something. I have no idea what any of this means but I just found that old paper while I was writing this (it wasn't a whole year it was just a semester), and I'm going to start doing my memorization on a screen that doesn't glow and I'm somehow even more suspicious of laptops and phones than I was before.

Saturday: Update: the paper was bad. Still mad about my screen glowing. I don't know what else to write! It's been fun hanging out. I've been doing memorizing on vacation but its a little bit irregular. I have been waking up on time. You can blame Michael for that.
